# shades-of-grey-syntax theme

Shades of grey is a simple, clean, minimal, low contrast, grey theme. It does not use a lot of different colors for different types of syntax. It works well with the [Atom Light UI theme] (https://atom.io/themes/atom-light-ui), as well as with the upcoming Shades of Grey UI theme.

Based on the default [Atom Light syntax theme] (https://atom.io/themes/atom-light-syntax).
